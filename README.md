####What Is This For?#### To give a brief introduction to me and serve as an easy-to-access demonstration of my coding. While my focus is cybersecurity, I learned the fundamentals of building a website for the likely chance I'll have to break one (or analyze how it was broken). The page uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

####What Else?#### A web page built with Bootstrap, and a link to my Linkedin, for a more personal page, and a link to my github repositories, for more projects
